                <p class="mb-4 text-white">Welcome aboard!</p>
                <p class="mb-4 text-gray-300">Aristotle once said, "We are what we repeatedly do". In Development, we repeatedly win. We do this because we repeatedly hire A players, and we think you are one of them.</p>
                <p class="mb-4 text-gray-300">You just might be in for one heck of a ride (career wise) here. The good kind. The kind you tell your kids or grandkids about down the road. This has been a wonderful adventure for all of us so far and I see no signs of it slowing down.</p>
                <p class="mb-4 text-gray-300">While we are on the road to victory, please do not forget that as fun or fulfilling as this all is, St. Augustine’s definition of fulfillment is far better, "To seek God is the greatest adventure; to find him, the greatest human achievement."</p>

                <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-2">Chapter 3: It’s a Process</h2>
                <p class="text-lg text-gray-300 mb-8">Sparking, building, and stewarding relationships is the core of what we do. The following process is a foundational guideline of how we handle this. Each relationship is unique, meaning that creativity within these ideas is greatly encouraged. However, almost every single relationship we’ve ever held with a partner has conceptually followed this framework:</p>
                
                <div class="space-y-8">
                    <div class="relative pl-8 border-l-2 border-gcu-purple/30">
                        <div class="absolute -left-[9px] top-0 w-4 h-4 rounded-full bg-gcu-purple"></div>
                        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-white mb-2">Identification</h3>
                        <p class="text-gray-400">Opportunities can come from anywhere. Ideally, the pool of potential relationships a Development Officer could pursue is a mix of both individuals that they’ve bumped into or been introduced to on their own, as well as presented to them through our internal lead funnel or referrals. In any case, understanding if an entity is suitable for partnership is crucial to the development process. This can be understood through tangible research, resourcefulness, and diligent but respectful inquiry.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="relative pl-8 border-l-2 border-gcu-purple/30">

                        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-white mb-2">Initial Contact / Opportunity</h3>
                        <p class="text-gray-400 mb-4">The initial contact or Quality Contact (QC) portion of the process indicates that someone on behalf of our team has actually spoken to the individual or proper representative of the entity. This can often blend with the identification portion of the process if validation of a potential relationship happens in real-time at events or “in the wild”.</p>
                        <p class="text-gray-400">When a QC takes place, it is incredibly important that it is reported using <a href="https://forms.gle/Ekd9j7mazZavWshs6" target="_blank" class="text-gcu-purple-light underline font-medium">this form</a>. Answer the questions accordingly, refrain from using letters in number-only fields, and be as detailed as possible. Try to describe what you think the next steps towards partnership are. A QC should also be submitted if you have additional conversations with the same person, or engage in conversation with someone else on behalf of the same entity of partnership.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="relative pl-8 border-l-2 border-gcu-purple/30">

                        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-white mb-2">Introduction of Partnership / Warm Lead</h3>
                        <p class="text-gray-400">The Warm Lead phase is where direct verification of alignment in values takes place. This often consists of one or multiple lunches or low-stakes meetings, or invites to campus events like basketball games. This is an opportunity to really show what GCU is all about, and to understand if any particular aspect of the institution intrigues the potential partner in any way. This gives great clarity on how a partnership proposal can be formed.</p>

                        <p class="text-gray-400">The Negotiation phase is ultimately where a proposal will be created and offered to the prospect, but can take many forms. The most common example of this action is by extending an invite to campus in which a tour or student/faculty meeting may take place, but ultimately ending with a proposal presentation for the donor to sign. This phase should require the largest form of preparation, and should always attempt to close a deal with a partner. This is also a phase that typically includes offering gifts or GCU swag items to the prospects, so preparing these according to the situation is important as well.</p>

                        <p class="text-gray-400">Closing a deal with a partner is a very exciting moment, and should be celebrating intentionally. This step may require one or multiple forms of signed documentation, so make sure you’ve prepared these items accordingly. Once the partnership is finalized, the stewardship process begins. You will work with the Director of Stewardship on how to best take care of this new relationship, and we have an incredible pool of offers for partners and their families. This may also require creative problem-solving between you and the Director of Stewardship on how to make these offerings unique. This is an ongoing process, and it’s important to create a cadence of interaction with partners throughout the contract duration.</p>

                    <p class="text-sm text-gray-400">Lead generation can take many forms, and a large portion of the identification process should be initiated by the Development Officer or the unit as a whole. However, we also have a constantly updating pool of leads based on certain criteria that is formed from multiple different systems. These leads can be explored for direct reach out, or for research. This lead pool can be found in Asana.</p>

                    <p class="text-sm text-gray-400 mb-2">We use Asana, a powerful project management tool, to mend the process of managing current and potential relationships to a process of productivity tracking. This is mostly used at large scale for the first four phases of the Development process (Identification, Opportunities, Warm Leads, and Negotiation), and moving each relationship throughout the pipeline will initiate things like subtasks and due dates.</p>
                    <p class="text-sm text-gray-400">There are also metrics and pieces of information regarding specific relationships that live and are updated directly in Asana, but are reflected automatically in other systems to assist with relationship tracking as well. Here is a comprehensive training on how we use Asana, and what your responsibilities are within the system.</p>

                    <p class="text-sm text-gray-400">Virtuous is a Customer Relationship Management software built specifically for managing and stewarding donors. We use this as a tool for relationship tracking within our current relationships. Once a partnership has been formed and the relationship has been moved to the final phase of the Development process in Asana, this information will be added to Virtuous by the Director of Stewardship. Ideally, most Development Officers and units won’t spend much time updating this system, but will regularly reference it for future relationship stewardship. This software also has an armada of automations to assist with partner communications.</p>
